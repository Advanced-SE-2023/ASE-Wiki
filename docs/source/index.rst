ThinkReal. Documentation
===================================

**ThinkReal.** gives you the opportunity to post what’s happening in your life every day. It’s not addictive, it’s not artificial, it’s real.

At a random time during the day, you share with your network what’s going on.

The application makes it possible to follow others and be up to date with what is happening in their lives. And it does so without any filters. It allows you to connect with real people, not shiny pictures of them.

Each user has a feed and a profile page. In the feed, current posts from followed users are published.
